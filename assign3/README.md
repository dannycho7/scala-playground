# CS 162 Regex repo

This repository contains the material from the livecoding sessions
during the class and the assignment templates provided to you. The
`master` branch (which is where you are reading this from) contains
the livecoding material. Each assignment has its own branch (`assign2`
for assignment 2, `assign3` for assignment 3, and so on). To switch to
(checkout in git terminology) a branch, you can run the following
command inside your clone of the repository:

```
git checkout <branch-name>
```

For example, `git checkout assign3` will switch to the branch
containing assignment 3's template and description.
